# Output folder for the generated Apache files

This folder is the folder where generated Apache files will be placed to.

If you want the original files to be replaced by Eassy, you can create soft links to the original files.

Eassy will generate the following files:

hosts - contains the host mappings
httpd-vhosts.conf - Apache virtual hosts file

In addition, Eassy will create all virtual hosts in seperate files as well.
